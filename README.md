In response to market dynamics, AtliQ Grands, a fictional hospitality powerhouse with a presence in four cities, embarked on a profound data-driven exploration to conquer challenges and propel business expansion.

The project unfolds in three pivotal stages:

🧹 𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑪𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈:

Ensuring precision in insights, I diligently polished the data:

Rectified negative values in the Number of Guests.

Eliminated outliers in Revenue Generated & Realized.

Addressed NaN/Null values in Ratings Given.

🔄 𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒔𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:

Converting raw data into actionable intelligence:

Introduced the concept of 'Occupancy Percentage' derived from successful bookings and capacity.

Explored nuanced insights based on the transformed dataset.

📊 Insights Generated:

🏢 Presidential rooms claim the highest occupancy rate.

🌆 Delhi leads in occupancy, closely trailed by other cities.

📅 Weekends exhibit higher occupancy (>70%) than weekdays (50.9%).

📉 Bangalore consistently records the lowest occupancy rate.

🗓️ August data might be incomplete, available only for Mumbai and Bangalore.

💰 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆 𝑨𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒊𝒔:

📈 Delhi boasts high occupancy but the least realized revenue.

💵 Mumbai emerges as the revenue frontrunner.

📊 Total revenue per month peaks in July.

🚀 Business Insights:

  Bangalore witnesses a noticeable dip in average successful bookings compared to Mumbai.

💡 Strategic insights into revenue from cancellations for AtliQ Industries hotels.

🌟 AtliQ Seasons excels in low cancellation rates, attributed to competitive pricing and strategic locations.

🌟 Service Quality and Ratings:

🌐 Average ratings remain consistent across all cities.

🌟 None of the ratings exceed ≥4, emphasizing the necessity for service quality enhancement.

🤔 𝑩𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑨𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒔𝒊𝒔:

🌐 40.9% of bookings originate from the 'others' payment method; strategic analysis is recommended for market capture.


🚀 Strategic Recommendations

Enhance Service Quality: Focus on elevating customer experience to improve ratings beyond 4.0.

Revenue Optimization in Delhi: Despite high occupancy, low realized revenue suggests pricing or revenue leakage issues.

Boost Bangalore Performance: Investigate low occupancy and successful booking rates to drive improvements.

Understand 'Others' Payment Method: Analyze customer preferences and optimize payment processing for market advantage.

By leveraging these insights, AtliQ Grands can refine its business strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable growth.
